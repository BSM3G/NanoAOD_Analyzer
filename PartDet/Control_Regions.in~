/////////// Control Region /////////////

//// This files allows for control regions to be processed using the analyzer code.  To activate control regions
//// run the code with the CR option, ie
////    ./Analyzer -CR <infile> <outfile>
////
//// The variables for control regions work by giving the fill group the variable is associated with and then
//// the variable.  Most fill groups are obvious based on the particle (Muon1's fill group is simple Muon1), but
//// other variables may have different, less obvious ones (eg VBF related cuts have the fill group "LeadingJets")
//// After this, the point that the control region is to be made at is given
//// ie
////     <Fill Group>_<Variable>  <value>
////
//// When running over data, to make sure the signal region is blinded in studying (since all regions are made 
////  when the code runs), the signal region needs to be defined and then the "Unblind" variable needs to be set 
//// to true or false.  To define the signal region, a ">" or "<" must be given for each control region variable
//// simply using the greater than or less than for whether the signal region is greater than or less than the 
//// given value for the variable
